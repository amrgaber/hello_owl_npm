# Hello Owl NPM Project

This is a simple Owl project that runs using NPM and the `serve` package.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and NPM installed on your system

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:
   ```
   cd path/to/hello_owl_npm
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run serve
   ```

4. Open your web browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

The project should now be running in your browser.

## Notes

- The `serve` package is used to run a local development server.
- The server will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files.
- If port 5000 is already in use, `serve` will automatically use the next available port.
